# Attic-Autobahn

This is a little 3D racing game that I made in September 2020. I put together some free assets and some basic scripts that I wrote.

You can find a trailer of this game in this link:

You can play the game by downloading "Attic Autobahn Prototype" .exe file from the Builds folder.

If you want to get access to Unity Project, please extract the zip files to the Assets folder.
