# Attic-Autobahn

This is a little 3D racing game that I made in September 2020. I put together some free assets and some basic scripts that I wrote.

You can find a trailer of this game in this link:

You can play the game by downloading "Attic Autobahn Prototype" zip file from this link:

If you want to get access to Unity Project without having any problem, please extract the zip files to the Assets folder.
